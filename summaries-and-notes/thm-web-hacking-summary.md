# Web Hacking - Summary

- Learned about web applications, ports, URLs, and HTTP messages (data packets between the user and the web server). Communication consists of requests (from the user) and responses (from the server), which attackers may try to intercept or manipulate.  
- Explored **JavaScript** — an interesting language used to create dynamic content on web pages.  
- Learned **SQL** basics. SQL is a language for building, querying, and modifying databases. Databases in SQL are essentially just tables. 🏓  
- Explored **Burp Suite** — a powerful tool for testing web application security. It uses a proxy to intercept traffic between the browser and the server, allowing the user to study and manipulate requests and responses.  
- **OWASP Top 10** 💯 — a non-profit project that publishes regular reports on the most critical security risks for web applications.
