# Learning Laboratory

This is my personal repository for learning Cybersecurity, Python and CS in general. It includes **cheatsheets** for quick references (code, commands, regexes, etc.), **summaries** of key concepts and "I finally get it" explanations, as well as my unique learning **projects**. This repository marks my progress through various topics and projects.

## 🚀 Highlights

- 🕹️ [**Simple RPG**](code-projects/03-rpg-game.py) is a short, text-based RPG written in Python featuring branching choices, humour, and a few surprises. Playable directly in the terminal or as a standalone .exe for Windows — no Python installation needed. [Download the game (.exe)](https://github.com/ztrbusic/learning-lab/releases/download/rpg-v1.0/05-rpg-game-v1.exe)
- 📚 [**Numerus Currens**](code-projects/02-numerus-currens.py) is a simple console-based library management simulator. It helps users practice entering, checking, and updating book records using basic text input and file handling in Python. Users can add shelves, add books to specific shelves, list all books, and search for books by keyword.

## 📁 Structure

- `cheatsheets/` – Cheatsheets help me quickly look up code, terminal commands, and keywords to be more efficient in their use.
- `code-projects/` -  Small tools that make life easier. Built for learning purposes but have practical value. Subdirectory `python-learning/` contains learning code files that I created doing assingments and practical exercises.
- `cyber-labs` - My collection of scripts, exploits, and practice labs from TryHackMe and other cybersecurity training exercises, some invented myself.
- `summaries-and-notes/` - Short texts that summarize key concepts. Summaries are used as milestones after finishing a big chapter or having "I finally get it" moments. Notes are short unstructured reminders, usually for Python.


## 🧠 Purpose

- Practice core Python and Cybersecurity concepts through hands-on coding and labs.
- Capture useful commands, syntax, and patterns for future reference in **cheatsheets** .
- Track progress through consistent **summaries**.
- Make useful automation tools in Python and explore Cybersecurity through personal lab projects.

## 🚧 Status

Active and evolving. This repository reflects my journey and learning process — not production-ready code.
