# Learning Laboratory

This is my personal repository for learning Python. It includes both code exercises and notes as I progress through various topics and projects.

## 🚀 Highlights

- 🕹️ [**Simple RPG**](projects/05-rpg-game.py) is a short, text-based RPG written in Python featuring branching choices, humour, and a few surprises. Playable directly in the terminal or as a standalone .exe for Windows — no Python installation needed. [Download the game (.exe)](https://github.com/ztrbusic/python-learning/releases/download/rpg-v1.0/05-rpg-game-v1.exe)
- 📚 [**Numerus Currens**](projects/02-numerus-currens.py) is a simple console-based library management simulator. It helps users practice entering, checking, and updating book records using basic text input and file handling in Python. Users can add shelves, add books to specific shelves, list all books, and search for books by keyword.

## 📁 Structure

- `learning-code/` – All Python scripts and exercises. Each file typically explores a specific concept, pattern, or small project.
- `notes/` – My learning notes and observations in Markdown format. Currently contains a single evolving `.md` file.
- `projects/` - Small tools that make life easier. Built for learning purposes but have practical value.

## 🧠 Purpose

- Practice core Python concepts through hands-on coding.
- Capture useful commands, syntax, and patterns for future reference.
- Track progress through consistent note-taking and file commits.
- Make useful automation tools to simplify life.

## 🚧 Status

Active and evolving. This repository reflects my journey and learning process — not production-ready code.
