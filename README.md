# Python Learning Repository

This is my personal repository for learning Python. It includes both code exercises and notes as I progress through various topics and projects.

## 📁 Structure

- `learning-code/` – All Python scripts and exercises. Each file typically explores a specific concept, pattern, or small project.
- `notes/` – My learning notes and observations in Markdown format. Currently contains a single evolving `.md` file.
- `projects/` - Small tools that make life easier. Built for learning purposes but have practical value.

## 🧠 Purpose

- Practice core Python concepts through hands-on coding.
- Capture useful commands, syntax, and patterns for future reference.
- Track progress through consistent note-taking and file commits.
- Make useful automation tools to simplify life.

## 🚧 Status

Active and evolving. This repository reflects my journey and learning process — not production-ready code.
