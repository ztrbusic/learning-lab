# Learning Laboratory

This is my personal repository for learning Cybersecurity, Python and CS in general. It includes **cheatsheets** for quick references (code, commands, regexes, etc.), **summaries** of key concepts and "I finally get it" explanations, as well as my unique learning **projects**. This repository marks my progress through various topics and projects.

## 🚀 Highlights

- 🕹️ [**Simple RPG**](projects/05-rpg-game.py) is a short, text-based RPG written in Python featuring branching choices, humour, and a few surprises. Playable directly in the terminal or as a standalone .exe for Windows — no Python installation needed. [Download the game (.exe)](https://github.com/ztrbusic/python-learning/releases/download/rpg-v1.0/05-rpg-game-v1.exe)
- 📚 [**Numerus Currens**](projects/02-numerus-currens.py) is a simple console-based library management simulator. It helps users practice entering, checking, and updating book records using basic text input and file handling in Python. Users can add shelves, add books to specific shelves, list all books, and search for books by keyword.

## 📁 Structure

- `archive/` – Anything old/raw that can be of later but not immediate use. Also old notes and temporary files. Will be curated in time and files will be appraised and dleted when necessary.
- `cheatsheets/` – Learning code and terminal commands can be overwhelming. Cheatsheets help me quickly remember them and be more efficient in their use. Possible subdirectories will be created for concepts that require more space and granularity (e.g. `python/`).
- `summaries/` - Short texts that summarize key concepts. Summaries will be used as milestones after finishing a big chapter or having "I finally get it" moments.
- `projects/` -  Small tools that make life easier. Cybersecurity labs and exercises. Built for learning purposes but have practical value. In addition, subdirectory `python-learning/` contains learning code files that I create when doing assingments and practical exercises.

## 🧠 Purpose

- Practice core Python and Cybersecurity concepts through hands-on coding and labs.
- Capture useful commands, syntax, and patterns for future reference in **cheatsheets** .
- Track progress through consistent **summaries**.
- Make useful automation tools in Python and explore Cybersecurity through personal lab projects.

## 🚧 Status

Active and evolving. This repository reflects my journey and learning process — not production-ready code.
