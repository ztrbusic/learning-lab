# Networking Summary

Learned about the **OSI** and **TCP/IP** models — OSI is conceptual, TCP/IP is what’s actually implemented. Helpful mnemonic for OSI: “Please Do Not Throw Spinach Pizza Away.” Understood differences between TCP (reliable, handshake) and UDP (faster, no delivery guarantee).  
Explored **addressing**: IPv4, broadcast, subnet masks, and private ranges.  
Looked at essential protocols: **DHCP** (DORA process), **ARP** for MAC resolution, **ICMP** for diagnostics. Learned about **routing** protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, RIP) and NAT.  
Went through common application protocols: **DNS** records (A, AAAA, MX, etc.), **HTTP** verbs, **FTP/SMTP/POP3/IMAP**. Then secure protocols: **TLS/SSL** and **SSH** (+ SFTP).  
Practiced tools: **tcpdump** for packet capture with filters and display options; **nmap** for scanning hosts, services, OS detection, with options like `-sS`, `-sU`, `-A`, and timing flags. Also touched **telnet** and **whois**.
