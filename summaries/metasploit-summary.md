# Metasploit Summary

Metasploit is a powerful tool for exploiting various vulnerabilities in different systems. It consists of modules and tools. Modules work as predefined programs that make certain exploits possible, e.g. port scanners, crawlers, encoders, evasion modules, etc. An **exploit** is the code that exploits a **vulnerability**, and a **payload** is the code that is implemented into a target system.  
One of the tools available in the suite is **msfvenom**, which is used to generate different payloads depending on the target system and needs.  
**Meterpreter** is actually a payload that functions as an agent inside the target system. It lives in memory and is used to run commands and control the system. There are multiple versions available.  
**Nmap**, Network Mapper, is a tool used for network discovery and security auditing. It scans ports, devices, and services.
